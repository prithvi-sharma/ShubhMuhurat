## What is Choghadiya?
Choghadiya is an ancient Vedic timekeeping system in Indian astrology that divides the day into segments of approximately 1.5 hours each, used to determine auspicious times for important activities. It consists of both favorable and unfavorable periods, helping individuals choose the best times for events.

## How to use
1. Open the site
2. Optionally : Choose Light/Dark mode by clicking on Sun/Moon
3. Choose Activity : Work Related / General Time / Money Related
4. Choose Period : Day / Night
5. Select a date : Default is today
6. Enter your city/state/country name for precise timezone so sunrise/sunset calculations are accurate
   </br><strong>NOTE</strong> : <i>Website DOES NOT track your location or timezone. Hence, default is Mumbai.</i>
7. Click on "Find Auspicious Time"
8. Read the list/timeline of Choghadiya blocks for the day. Favorable blocks are highlighted for quick scanning.
9. Pick the best time for your event — plan confidently!

Notes:
- Choghadiya depends on sunrise and sunset times, so accuracy improves with correct timezone/location input.
- Use it as a helpful guide rather than an absolute rule
- Always remember, best time is when YOU start!
